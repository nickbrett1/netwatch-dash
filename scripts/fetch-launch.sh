# fetch-launch: install the newest release for THIS host and exec it.
#
# Run once per host start: a systemd unit, a launchd agent, or by hand. It is
# deliberately not a daemon - no polling, no timer, no rollback, no blue-green.
# One fetch, one symlink flip, one exec.
#
#   read the release manifest at a URL that never contains a version
#   -> already current: exec what is installed
#   -> otherwise: download the asset for this host's target, verify its sha256,
#      unpack it into releases/<version>/, flip the `current` symlink
#   -> exec current/bin/<name>
#
# FAIL OPEN IS THE FIRST RULE. A host must never fail to boot because GitHub was
# unreachable, the manifest was odd, or this host's target was missing from it.
# Every failure below logs and execs `current` exactly as it is found. The one
# case that cannot fail open is a cold host with nothing installed yet: there is
# nothing to exec, so it exits non-zero and says so.
#
# The escape hatch is NO_FETCH=1, which skips the fetch entirely (useful when a
# host must stay on the version it has).
#
# Layout, all under DEPLOY_DIR (default: $HOME/.local/share/netwatch-dash):
#
#   releases/<version>/     an unpacked payload; the entry point is bin/<name>
#   current -> releases/<version>
#
# ENV_FILE (default: $HOME/.config/netwatch-dash/env) is sourced, with `set -a`,
# immediately before the exec, so host-local configuration reaches an app
# fetched from GitHub. It is optional and it is not part of a release: keep the
# host's secrets there, never in the payload.
#
# genproj seeds this file once; after that it is yours. `scripts/` is app-owned,
# so regeneration never overwrites it - unlike .buildkite/pipeline.yml, which is
# genproj's and is rewritten on every regeneration.
#
# Flags are forwarded to the payload, so `fetch-launch --help` is the payload's
# `--help`.

# Tell the payload what started it, so an app's own status endpoint can report

#
# Three values, and each one fails open to empty: a payload started by hand (a
# test, a developer's `cargo run`) has no launcher to describe, and a host with
# no sha256 tool must still boot.
#
#   - The *version* is the release this launcher last verified itself against,
#     which is the only version a launcher has. It is fetched fresh from
#     whichever release is current rather than versioned on its own, so there is
#     no separate launcher version to report.
#   - The *digest* is taken after self_update because the file on disk is the
#     one that supervises the *next* start (a swap takes effect then, not now).
#     Held against a release manifest's `launcher.sha256` it answers "is this
#     host's launcher current?" - a mismatch that the launcher could not see
#     itself, because seeing it is what it just tried to do.
#
# Both can therefore lag the payload by one start, and neither is a promise: the
# payload is being told what its launcher believes, which is all any process
# knows about the process that started it.

# Replace this file with the one the manifest advertises, before the payload is
# fetched. This is what makes the launcher a release asset: without it the code
# that supervises everything else only changes when a human visits the box (a
# real host ran a launcher four commits stale while its payload self-updated
# happily underneath).
#
# THE FROZEN FLOOR IS THIS FUNCTION: read the manifest, verify a sha256, rename
# over the path, exec, fail open. Everything above that floor changes with any
# release, because the copy that runs it is the copy being replaced - so the
# floor has to be small enough to be obviously right. Two rules keep it safe:
#
#   - Verify before swapping, and fail open. A truncated download, a GitHub
#     error page, a checksum mismatch, or a file that does not parse leaves the
#     working launcher exactly where it is and the host still boots. The sha256
#     comes from the same manifest as the asset, so it guards against corruption
#     and not against a hostile release - the same trust the payload already has.
#   - Rename over the path; never write through it. bash reads a script lazily,
#     off its inode, as it runs, so rewriting this file in place would corrupt
#     the running process mid-execution. `mv` of a new file onto the name gives
#     the new inode a fresh name and leaves this process reading the inode it
#     already has open. (Same reasoning as the `current` flip below: the bug
#     there was also a `mv` doing something other than the obvious.)
#
# A manifest with no "launcher" entry - an older release, or a project with no
# release pipeline - is a no-op, not a failure.
